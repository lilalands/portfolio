<h2>Station Liminal</h2>
<p>Station Liminal (or The Museum of The In-Betweens) is an imaginary space manifested as a ghost metro station. It is an institution dedicated to collecting physical and mental liminal spaces* and displaying them in suitable ways, such as a VR archive, a cinema room and large exhibition space that consists of the whole metro station and its dead-end tunnels. In this fictional scenario Station Liminal has invited Todd Hido and Michael Schmidt to show their photographs concerning liminality.

*Liminal space - 1. a state or place characterized by being transitional or intermediate in some way 2. Informal. any location that is unsettling, uncanny, or dreamlike
