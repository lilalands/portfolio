<h3>ATOMICA</h3>
<p>ATOMICA is a modular typeface created in the LetterStudio elective at KABK. The letters are based on the identity points of brutalist architecture - monumental in size, heavy and arguably ugly, powerful and industrial. They are inspired by the unusual combination of shapes and their geometrical asymmetric patterns, which can give off a dystopian feeling.
